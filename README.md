This is the project repo for Huifang Wang. Here are some instructions on running the script. 

1. My bash script run.sh use python3 to run python as follows: 
   $ python3 ./src/Purchase.py
   If the test system use different name, please change to the right name. Then compile it and run:
   $ chmod +x run.sh
   $ ./run.sh

2. The python script Purchase.py currently reads order_products__train.csv dataset, which has been renamed as order_products.csv.
   In my own test folder: under the insight_testsuite/testsmyowntest/, the Purchase.py script reads the simple test dataset provided by insight.
